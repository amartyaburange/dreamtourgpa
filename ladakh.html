   <h1><b> Explorable Ladakh</b></h1>
   <p>Ladakh is one of the highest regions of the world.
 Its natural features consist mainly of high plains and deep valleys.
 The high plain predominates in the east, diminishing gradually toward the west.
 In southeastern Ladakh lies Rupshu, an area of large, brackish lakes with a
 uniform elevation of about 13,500 feet (4,100 metres). To the northwest of Rupshu 
lies the Zaskar Range, an inaccessible region where the people and the cattle remain indoors
 for much of the year because of the cold. Zaskar is drained by the Zaskar River, which, flowing
 northward, joins the Indus River below Leh. In the heart of Ladakh, farther to the north, cultivation
 by means of manuring and irrigation is practiced by farmers living in valley villages at elevations
 between about 9,000 and 15,000 feet (2,750 and 4,550 metres). Shepherds tend flocks in the upland valleys
 that are too high for cultivation. Leh, the most accessible town of Ladakh, is an important trade centre
 located 160 miles (260 km) east of Srinagar. <div><b> Here are
